# QA Testing

## Base cases

1) (/) Routed -> accept -> Pause -> unpause
  ensure capacity goes up and down as we pause and unpause
2) (/) Routed -> decline
  ensure you go to unavailable
3) (/) Routed -> pause -> unpause
  ensure that there are no changes to capacity

## Changing case

h2. (/) Wrap-up case
Routed -> wrap-up -> pause -> unpaused
  ensure that work-session capacity is not affected
  Beforehand the capacityRemaining would go above total capacity here.
