# Staging Testing

(/) = pass
(f) = fail

## Base cases

1) () Routed -> accept -> Pause -> unpause
  ensure capacity goes up and down as we pause and unpause
2) (/) Routed -> decline -> available
  ensure you go to unavailable
3) (/) Routed -> pause -> unpause
  ensure that there are no changes to capacity

## Changing cases

1) () Routed -> wrap-up -> pause -> unpaused
  ensure that work-session capacity is not affected
  Beforehand the capacityRemaining would go above total capacity here.

## Notes
curl to put a work-item into wrap-up
```
curl -X PATCH "${STAGING_API_URL}/v1/conversations/<<ConversationIdâ‰¥>" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${STAGING_OWNER_AUTH_TOKEN}" \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "ended": true
}'
```
