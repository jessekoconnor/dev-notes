# Katrina Rodriguez

## What are the best things about working with this individual?

Excellent communication skills; I recall several occasions of clear communication skills when interacting with katrina, one example is when I was working on setting a BE limit on the number of queues that users are allowed to create. It was one of the first times that I was in the this code base and katrina allowed me to ask all sorts of questions and shared her screen as we explored the repository. She presented me with ample opportunity to absorb her knowlege of the service in clear yet technical terms that I really appreciated. She has a solid technical foundation that supports her in communicating w/ clear terms and unambiguous meaning. 
Not only can I tell that katrina is open minded and a team player, she is a great collaborator; I recall a time when Katrina helped me to think through a new feature regarding the latest wait time for a queue. She allowed me to bounce new ideas off of her all the while providing helpful input and sharing her technical knowlege of each topic that was covered. 


## Things that I wish this individial had done differently, or suggested ares of focus for her:

I havnt seen anything that I wish katrina had done differently. That said, I have been thinking about a few strategies and suggested areas of focus that were instrumental in my own career, and in the hopes that katrina may find some of them intruiging, I will list them below:

* The Passionate Programmer, Creating a remarkable career in software develepment:
    * This is a favorite book of mine, and I would like to formally recomend it. I've read it twice already and still consider picking it up again in the future. Its all about breaking down what it means to be a software engineer, and the skills and mechanisms that you can invest in to flourish as a programmer. This book has definately impacted my career greatly.

* Do you have a mentor/mentee? 
    * Many people never find the time to invest in a mentor or mentee relationship. But if you can find the time to select a mentor/mentee it can benefit you hugely. In my own personal experience I have had several mentors that have all helped me with important but difficult to understand concepts and questions that were too complex for me to truly comprehend at the time. An example of this is understanding as a jr engineer that working with javascript is a pretty good career bet because of how widely adopted it is as well as its tenure in such a position. If you can find a mentor then you will not regret it. I have actually been thinking lately about finding a mentee for myself - let me know if you know of anyone looking for a mentor :D 

* Generalized engineering skills (proficiency with many different technologies and stack layers (ex: reasonable proficiency in all of mongo, node, react, elk, sqs, sns, and cloudfront)); 
    * What does your general engineering skillset spread look like? When is the last time you gave your general skillset an honest evaluation? Are there any general engineering skills that could use some investment? This can sometimes be a low hanging piece of fruit to improve your performance as an engineer if you notice some skills lagging behind in proficiency in comparison to other skills.

* Specialized engineering skills:
    * Specialization, or focusing on a single technology, can make you an expert in that technology. Could this be something your interested in and if so which technology would you choose to focus on? I have personally chosen to specialize to some degree in nodejs. A good example of my own specialization effort is chipping away at the nodejs documentation with the goal of reading the entire thing (maybe more than onceover) which I have since accomplished. Next I started looking up presentations and talks given by the engineers writing the langage. Finally, I started making open source contributions to node, and continue to do so when I have the time. Obviously nodejs is awesome, but theres many other skills to specialize in, and if you choose to specialize to any degree it should be in a tech that cultivated honest curiousity and fascination. 

* Time management:
    * Have you looked into any sort of time management techniques for your day to day work routine? It could be overkill, in fact many people go their whole lives without putting any time and energy into time management. However I like to think that if you can master your day to day routine then you can accelerate your level of success and achievement to see an increased velocity over time. Check out the pomodoro technique if you havnt already, I am currently working to integrate this techniqueue in my own daily life here at kustomer, and I it feels good to have a system. This book contains strategies for constantly refocusing on your highest priority work as well as managing distractions that come in ad-hoc.
    * Pomodoro Technoqie Illustrated by Staffan NÃ¶teberg: https://www.amazon.com/Pomodoro-Technique-Illustrated-Easy-Pragmatic/dp/1934356506/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1UI24V69U7RJJ&dchild=1&keywords=pomodoro+technique&qid=1614446969&sprefix=pomodoro+technique%2Caps%2C161&sr=8-4

* Command line skills:
    * If I am off base with this one, so please ignore if I got this wrong. I added this one to the list because I feel that command line proficiency makes life for BE engineers better. I know there are a lot of software and applications out there that allow us engineers to get away with avoiding the command like the plague, but I think this actually hurts in the long run. Most of the time there are no issues with using these application, but some of the time they have bugs or dont allow you to do exactly what you need to do; and more often than not they are actually using those same commands under the hood that are available via the command line. There are tons of free courses on unix command line skills and free gamified learning platforms on the internet on, so there is no shortage of resources. Let me know if your interested in learning more on the subject, I have lots of suggestions :D

* Blimp
    * Check out blimp, its pretty awesome and super similar to docker-compose. I recently helped sergey get it up and running, and can offer help if you choose to check it out and run into any issues.
