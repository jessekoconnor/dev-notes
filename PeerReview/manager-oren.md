# Oren manager review

## Choose one question to answer below. State the question you are choosing in your answer

What do you appreciate about the leadership style of your manager?

Oren takes the time to explain complex issues demonstrating great Teamwork. I remember a time when oren set aside an hour to explain the architecture of the Workflow => BizRule => QnR Pipeline and how a workflow can modify conversations in this process. When I didnt understand something he then explained it in a different way.

I like how oren will keep me in the loop and help me brainstorm how I can best contribute to the teams goals and OKRs to maximize my impact; this is an example of Leadership which helps me to maximize my impact. I remember when oren and I were discussing how we could solve a difficult QnR problem that involved a workflow induced race condition, and as part of the discussion Oren suggested that I attempt to recreate the workflow conditions in the integration tests. This suggestion set me down a path where we now have this exact workflow race condition in 2 integration tests running every day as we speak.

Oren is also a great code reviewer, he is very knowledgable of the platform services, and he offers words of appreciation on a regular basis.

What meetings/processes/protocols could be conducted more effectively?

Seems like groomings could be 45/50 min, we always hit the sweetspot right before 30 min. I think it could have to do with how we do standup right within this short period of time. 
I also think it would be beneficial if we occasionally met and went over OKR progress as Ludwig was suggenting a few weeks back. I wonder if there is some sweet spot type of frequency where its not too tedious but is instead convenient.
