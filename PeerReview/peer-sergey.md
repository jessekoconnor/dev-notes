# Sergey

## What were the best things about working with this individual?

Sergey is excellent at idintifying and capturing test cases. I remember a time where I was dealing w/ a sensative p1 issue where sergey was very helpful. I was on a call talking about the newly reported issue and we were wondering if it was reproducible in a sandbox org or not. Sergey hopped on the call and in seconds reported that it is indeed reproducible in sandbox orgs, and thoroughly explained the repro steps. I think he even reproduced it several times for us while screen sharing. This allowed me skip over the phase of testing it myself, and instead then dive straight into discussions about a solution, maximizing the time that I have to solve the issue.

Sergey also has some great russian recipees, is a lot of fun to be around, and has great stories. I am super excited to finally meet him in person at Kamp.

## What was something you wish this individual had done differently or are suggested areas of focus for him/her/them?

I would suggest that sergey invest some of his spare time in two areas of focus. I think that working at a full stack javascript company, it can only be helpful to continue learning more about javascript and getting more and more confortable with looking at it. I think that sergey may be in the process of actually doing this now, but if he has given it up I would encourage him to pick it back up.
Additionally, I think sergey would benefit from the following course about how to write well written emails linked below. My french friend took this course and he really liked it, as writing english is not easy. It is however an invaluable skill that will benefit the rest of your career.
