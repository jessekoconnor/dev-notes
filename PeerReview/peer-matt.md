# Matthew Goldman

## What were the best things about working with this individual?

Matt often serves as a resource for me to learn and understand new parts of the product. A good example of this is during the CWF work, matt showed me how to add a local app to the ecosystem by taking some time aside to allow me to drive so that I understood how to add apps. Another example of this is when I was asking about how I can publish an event to pusher from the BE, matt met with me and gave me a code tour of how SNS and SQS can be used to create an event in pusher in notification. This helped me to get up to speed faster and have more time to increase the quality of my work.

Matt also has a great attitude, and his wide ranging product knowlege and prev implementation engineer experience enables matt to move untra fast.

* Seems to know so much about the product
* Wide ranging knowlege of FE and BE ()
* Great attitude
  * attitude of getting stuff done

## What was something you wish this individual had done differently or are suggested areas of focus for him/her/them?

I think you should keep pushing down the full stack path, because theres a lot of power/speed/fame that can come along with being able to do that. In order to do so I believe you should focus on learning more about javascript in general by watching Crockford, and/or dive deeper into nodejs.

* Start getting familiar w/ node
  * Dont block the event loop: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/blocking-vs-non-blocking/
  * Video1 (Great event loop talk): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphcsoSJMvM
  * Awesome podcast on nodejs at netflix "restify at Netflix with Tunong Xiao": https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/javascript-software-engineering-daily/id1232093829

* Dive deeper into javascript:
  * Crockford on Javascript (8 videos, all are gold but no need to binge): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg&list=PL7664379246A246CB
